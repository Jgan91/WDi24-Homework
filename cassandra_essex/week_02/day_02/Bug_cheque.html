  <aside>
      Knuth reward cheques are cheques or cheque-like certificates awarded by computer scientist Donald Knuth for finding mathematical errors, or making substantial suggestions for his publications. $2.56 each error found, this corresponds to one hexadecimal doller.

    <h4>HOW MUCH?</h4>
    <p>In the preface of each of his books and on his website, Knuth offers a <b>reward of $2.56 (USD) to the first person to find each error in his published books,</b> whether it be technical, typographical, or historical. Knuth explains that $2.56, or 256 cents, corresponds to one hexadecimal dollar.[8] "Valuable suggestions" are worth 32 cents, or about  1⁄8 of the errors in the book (0.2 hexadecimal dollars or 20 hexadecimal cents). In his earlier books a smaller reward was offered. For example, the 2nd edition of The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1, offered $2.00.<br><br><br>

    The reward for coding errors found in Knuth's TeX and Metafont programs (as distinguished from errors in Knuth's books) followed an audacious scheme inspired by the Wheat and Chessboard Problem. It started at $2.56, and doubled every year until it reached $327.68.[2] Recipients of this "sweepstakes" reward include Chris Thompson (Cambridge) and Bogusław L. Jackowski (Gdansk), and also Peter Breitenlohner on 20 March 1995.<br><br>

    Each check's memo field identifies the book and page number. 1.23 indicates an error on page 23 of Volume 1. (1.23) indicates a valuable suggestion on that page. The symbol Θ denotes the book Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About, KLR denotes the book Mathematical Writing (by Knuth, Larrabee, and Roberts), GKP and CM denote the book Concrete Mathematics (by Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik). f1 denotes fascicle 1, CMT denotes the book Computer Modern Typefaces, DT denotes the book Digital Typography, SN denotes Surreal Numbers, CWEB denotes the book The CWEB System of Structured Documentation, DA denotes the book Selected Papers on Design of Algorithms, FG denotes the book Selected Papers on Fun and Games, and MM denotes the book MMIXware - A RISC Computer for the Third Millennium.
