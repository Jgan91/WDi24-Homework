    <div class="one"><p>Worked on
      UNIVAC I which was the first large scale electronic digital computer. She developed a compiler, the A-O, which improved binary code. It translated symbolic mathematical code to machine code. Using the FLOW-MATIC, Hopper and her team made the UNIVAC ‘understand’ twenty statements in english. At first her idea that a programming language could be developed in English was rejected. She thought that programming languages should be as easily understood as English. The FLOW-MATIC greatly influenced the creation of COBOL. Both were language compilers, which make code into more readable languages.

      Rear Admiral Grace Hopper studied at Vassar, Yale and Harvard. She held a Doctorate in Mathematics. She worked as a professor and an orator. She had trademark analogies and examples. For example, she encouraged programmers not to waste even a microsecond using a wire a foot long to represent a nanosecond. Most famously she joined the US naval reserve during WWII. She worked at Harvard, at the Cruft laboratories, on the Mark series of computers. Did you know that Mark I weighed 4500kg.She also worked at several computer corporations and kept working with the navy until 1986.
