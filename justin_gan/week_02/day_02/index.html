          <h1>---lARRY WALL---&#0167;</h1>

          <h2>Why does Joel admire Larry Wall?</h2>

          <p>
            Larry, much like Joel, also <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/" target="_blank">gives zero fucks about visual design and is just as unapologetic about it.</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            Larry is the <a href="trivia.html">Chuck Norris of programming</a>. Creator of the <a href="perl.html">Perl programming language</a>, Larry is a <span class="tooltip">Benevolent Dictator For Life<span class="tooltiptext"><strong>Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)</strong> is a title given to a few open-source software dev leaders who have the final say in community disputes</span></span> who makes no apologies for his take no prisoners approach to programming.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, the official Perl documentation states:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Larry is always by definition right about how Perl should behave. This means he has final veto power on the core functionality.</li>
            <li>Larry is allowed to change his mind about any matter at a later date, regardless of whether he previously invoked Rule 1. Got that? <strong>Larry is always right, even when he was wrong.</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <h2>What doesn't Joel know about Larry Wall?</h2>

          <p>
            Larry would rather eat 100 pounds of shoe leather over a 1 pound steak because he feels a greater sense of accomplishment after the eating the shoe leather (possibly taken out of context - see video below).
