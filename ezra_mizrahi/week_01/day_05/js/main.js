/*

Create a program that models a simple subway system.

The program takes the line and stop that a user is getting on at,
and the line and stop that the user is getting off at,
and prints the journey and the total number of stops for the trip.

There are 3 subway lines:

The N line has the following stops:
Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th

The L line has the following stops:
8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st

The 6 line has the following stops:
Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.

All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square,
but there are no other intersection points.
(For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different
than the 28th street stop on the 6 line,
so you'll have to differentiate this when you name your stops in the arrays.)

Tell the user the number of stops AND the stops IN THE ORDER
that they will pass through or change at.

The key to the lab is finding the index positions of each stop.
(hint: indexOf())

Make sure the stops that are the same for different lines have different names
(i.e. 23rd on the N and on the 6 need to be differentiated)
